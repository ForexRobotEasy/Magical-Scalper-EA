## Initialization Function

The `OnInit` function is called during the EA initialization. It sets up the necessary chart and trading functions for multiple currency pairs.

## Tick Function

The `OnTick` function is called on every tick. It checks if it's the first tick and initializes the grid system if necessary. It also checks for new trades and applies trailing stop to open trades if enabled.

## Grid System Initialization

The `InitializeGrid` function calculates the grid levels based on the minimum and maximum prices of the symbol. It then places initial trades at the grid levels.

## Placing New Trades

The `PlaceTrades` function checks if the current price has crossed a grid level and places new trades accordingly.

## Buy and Sell Functions

The `Buy` and `Sell` functions place buy and sell orders at the specified price, respectively.

## Applying Trailing Stop

The `ApplyTrailingStop` function iterates through all open trades and modifies the stop loss level based on the trailing stop value.
